# Volunteer Guide

Help us build the most accurate sexual health directory for NYC.

## What We Need

**Priority 1: Missing Hours** — 12 clinics have no hours listed. A 2-minute call can fix this.

**Priority 2: Verify Phone/Address** — A few clinics may have outdated contact info.

## How to Help

1. Pick a clinic from the [Call List](VOLUNTEER_CALL_LIST.md)
2. Call during business hours
3. Submit findings via [contact form](https://sexualhealth.nyc/contact)

## Phone Script

**Intro:**

> "Hi, I'm calling from sexualhealth.nyc — we're a free directory helping New Yorkers find sexual health services. I wanted to verify your hours so we can send patients to you at the right times."

**Questions to ask:**

- "What are your hours for [STI testing / PrEP / the sexual health clinic]?"
- "Do you accept walk-ins, or appointment only?"
- "Do you close for lunch?"

**Before hanging up:**

> "If your hours change, is there an email we can contact to update your listing?"

## Tips

- **Hospital hours ≠ clinic hours.** The ER is 24/7 but the Family Planning clinic might be Mon-Fri 9-5. Always ask for the specific department.
- **Registration cutoffs.** "We close at 5pm but stop taking patients at 4pm" — note the 4pm.
- **Get their email.** Direct contact info for future updates is valuable.
