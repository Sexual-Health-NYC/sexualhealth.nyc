# Volunteer Guide

Help us build the most accurate sexual health directory for NYC.

## Before you call

Look up the clinic on our site first. Know what services we list for them so you can verify intelligently. If we say they offer PrEP, ask about PrEP. If we say they do abortion, ask about that. Don't ask a PrEP clinic about abortion services.

Clinic staff are busy. Be efficient, friendly, and genuinely curious. If they seem rushed, offer to call back.

## The call

**Start with:**

> "Hi, I'm a volunteer with sexualhealth.nyc — we're a free directory helping New Yorkers find sexual health services. I'm calling to make sure our listing for [clinic name] is accurate. Do you have a couple minutes?"

If yes, verify what's relevant to that clinic. If no, ask when's a better time.

**Core questions (for any clinic):**

- What are your hours? (If a hospital: "specifically for the sexual health clinic or family planning department")
- Do you take walk-ins or is it appointment only?
- Is there a registration cutoff before closing?

**Before you hang up:**

> "If your hours or services ever change, is there an email we can reach out to?"

This contact info is valuable for future updates.

## Service-specific questions

Only ask these if we list the clinic as offering that service.

### STI testing / HIV testing

- How long for results?
- Anonymous testing available?
- Any age restrictions?

### PrEP

- Do you prescribe PrEP on-site or refer out?
- Informed consent model, or do patients need prior appointments/labs first?
- PrEP-AP (financial assistance) available?

### Abortion

- Medication abortion: up to how many weeks?
- Procedural abortion: up to how many weeks?
- Sedation options?

### Gender-affirming care

- Hormone therapy: informed consent, or letters required?
- Do you see patients under 18?
- Surgical referrals available?

### Contraception

- IUD insertion available?
- Same-day or appointment needed?

## Tips

**Hospital vs. clinic hours.** The ER is 24/7 but the Family Planning clinic might be Mon-Fri 9-5. Always ask about the specific department.

**Lunch breaks.** Some clinics close 12-1pm. Worth asking.

**Registration cutoff.** "We close at 5pm but stop taking patients at 4pm" — note the earlier time.

**Use judgment.** If the person sounds stressed or confused by a question, skip it. We can always call back. Don't waste their time reading a script robotically.

**Trust but verify.** If something sounds wrong ("we don't do PrEP" but we have them listed for PrEP), it's worth a gentle "oh interesting, our records show you do — maybe that changed recently?" Sometimes the front desk doesn't know all services.
