# Volunteer Guide

Help us build the most accurate sexual health directory for NYC. We now have **175 physical clinics + 9 virtual** listed. **Only 19 clinics are missing hours data** — this is where we need the most help.

## Before you call

Look up the clinic on our site first. Note what services we list for them — you'll only ask about those. A clinic that does PrEP and STI testing doesn't need questions about abortion.

## The call

**Opening:**

> "Hi, I'm a volunteer with sexualhealth.nyc — we're a free directory helping New Yorkers find sexual health services. I'm calling to make sure our listing for [clinic name] is accurate. Do you have a couple minutes?"

If they're busy, ask when's better and call back then.

**Core questions:**

- What are your hours? (At hospitals, ask specifically about the sexual health clinic or family planning department — not the ER)
- Walk-ins accepted, or appointment only?
- Any registration cutoff before closing?

**Closing:**

> "If your hours or services change, is there an email we can reach out to?"

Direct contact info helps us keep listings current.

## Service-specific questions

Ask these based on what we list for the clinic.

**STI / HIV testing**

- How long for results?
- Anonymous testing available?

**PrEP**

- Prescribed on-site or referral?
- Informed consent, or prior appointments/labs needed?
- PrEP-AP financial assistance available?

**Abortion**

- Medication abortion up to how many weeks?
- Procedural abortion up to how many weeks?
- Sedation available?

**Gender-affirming care**

- Hormones: informed consent or letters required?
- Patients under 18 seen?
- Surgical referrals?

**Contraception**

- IUD insertion on-site?
- Same-day or scheduled?

## Notes

Hospital hours aren't clinic hours. The building may be open 24/7, but Family Planning might only see patients Mon-Fri 9-5.

Some clinics close for lunch (12-1pm is common). Some stop taking patients 30-60 minutes before closing.

If something doesn't match our records — "we don't do PrEP" when we have them listed for it — worth a gentle follow-up: "oh interesting, maybe that changed recently?" Front desk staff don't always know every service.

## Submitting findings

Use our [contact form](https://sexualhealth.nyc/contact) or update Airtable directly if you have access.

Include: clinic name, date called, what you learned, and who you spoke with if they gave a name.
