# Volunteer Data Verification & Outreach Guide

Thank you for helping us build the most accurate sexual health resource for NYC! Your calls serve two purposes: **verifying critical data** and **introducing clinics to this free resource**.

## 🎯 Current Goal: Fill the Gaps
We have 75 clinics in our database, but **26 of them are missing operating hours**. This is our top priority.

## 📋 Your Task
1.  **Pick a clinic** from the [Call List](VOLUNTEER_CALL_LIST.md).
2.  **Call them** during business hours.
3.  **Verify** the information below.
4.  **Submit** your findings via our [Correction Form](https://sexualhealth.nyc/contact) (or the Airtable form if you have access).

## 📞 Script

### 1. Introduction
> "Hi, I'm calling from **sexualhealth.nyc** — we're building a free, non-profit directory to help New Yorkers find sexual health services. I just wanted to verify your current operating hours to make sure we're sending patients to you at the right times."

### 2. Verification Questions
*   "What are your specific hours for **[STI testing / PrEP / Abortion services]**?" (Many clinics have general hospital hours that differ from specific service hours).
*   "Do you accept walk-ins, or is it appointment only?"
*   "Are there specific hours for walk-ins?"

### 3. Closing & Future Contact (Important!)
> "Thank you! One last thing — if your hours or services ever change, is there a specific email address we can contact to update our listing? We want to keep your page accurate."

*(Record this email if given — it's gold for future maintenance!)*

## 📝 What to Watch Out For
*   **Department Hours vs. General Hours:** Hospitals often have a main line open 24/7, but the *Sexual Health Clinic* might only be open Mon-Fri 9-5. **Always ask for the specific clinic hours.**
*   **Lunch Breaks:** Some clinics close from 12-1pm. Ask if they close for lunch.
*   **Registration Cut-off:** "We close at 5pm, but stop taking patients at 4pm." Record the 4pm time if possible, or note it.
