# Volunteer Data Verification Guide

Thank you for helping us build the most accurate sexual health resource for NYC!

## 🎯 Current Goal: Fill the Gaps
We have 75 clinics in our database, but **26 of them are missing operating hours**. This is our top priority.

## 📋 Your Task
1.  **Pick a clinic** from the [Call List](VOLUNTEER_CALL_LIST.md).
2.  **Call them** during business hours.
3.  **Verify** the information below.
4.  **Submit** your findings via our [Correction Form](https://sexualhealth.nyc/contact) (or the Airtable form if you have access).

## 📞 Script
> "Hi, I'm verifying information for a free NYC health directory (sexualhealth.nyc). I just wanted to quickly confirm your operating hours for sexual health services. Are you open today?"

**Key Questions:**
*   "What are your hours for [STI testing / PrEP / Abortion services]?" (Specify service based on clinic type)
*   "Do you accept walk-ins, or is it appointment only?"
*   "Are there specific hours for walk-ins?"

## 📝 What to Watch Out For
*   **Department Hours vs. General Hours:** Hospitals often have a main line open 24/7, but the *Sexual Health Clinic* might only be open Mon-Fri 9-5. **Always ask for the specific clinic hours.**
*   **Lunch Breaks:** Some clinics close from 12-1pm. Ask if they close for lunch.
*   **Registration Cut-off:** "We close at 5pm, but stop taking patients at 4pm." Record the 4pm time if possible, or note it.
