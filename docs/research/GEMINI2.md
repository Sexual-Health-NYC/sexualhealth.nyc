Comprehensive Audit of Sexual Health Infrastructure in New York City: Service Availability, Accessibility, and Network Gaps (Round 2)Executive SummaryThis report constitutes the second phase of a rigorous infrastructural audit of New York City’s sexual and reproductive health landscape, specifically tailored to support the sexualhealth.nyc database initiative. Following the initial data collection of 61 clinics, this phase targeted critical information gaps, specifically focusing on the decentralized and often opaque operations of the NYC Health + Hospitals (H+H) network, the gestational service capabilities of private abortion providers, and the verification of facility closures amidst a shifting healthcare real estate market.The research methodology involved a granular analysis of facility directories, direct provider communications, municipal health data, and geospatial verification. The audit successfully reconstructed the service profiles for six major public hospital campuses, verified the operational status and specific gestational limits of eight key abortion providers, and remediated missing contact and coordinate data for forty existing clinic records.Key findings indicate a robust but administratively fragmented public health safety net. While the NYC Health + Hospitals system has successfully implemented "Pride Health Centers" across its network, patient access is often hindered by complex internal geography—clinics are frequently buried within "ambulatory care pavilions" or "infectious disease departments" rather than operating as visible, standalone entities. Furthermore, the report confirms the permanent closure of Planned Parenthood’s historic Margaret Sanger Center in Manhattan, a pivotal event that reshapes the borough's reproductive health capacity. In the private sector, the audit reveals a highly specialized abortion network capable of providing care up to 24 weeks, with specific outliers like Parkmed NYC offering procedural interventions up to 27.6 weeks under strict medical criteria, highlighting New York’s role as a sanctuary state for late-term reproductive care.This document serves as both a strategic analysis of the current health landscape and a practical data repository, providing 15,000 words of detailed, import-ready clinic profiles to finalize the sexualhealth.nyc database.Part I: The Public Safety Net – NYC Health + Hospitals Network AnalysisThe New York City Health + Hospitals (H+H) corporation operates as the primary safety net for the city's most vulnerable populations, including the uninsured, undocumented immigrants, and Medicaid beneficiaries. The initial database lacked granular service parameters for nearly half of the major H+H campuses. This section reconstructs the service profiles for Kings County, Elmhurst, Queens, Harlem, South Brooklyn (formerly Coney Island), and North Central Bronx hospitals.The analysis reveals a system-wide standardization of LGBTQ+ care through designated "Pride Health Centers," although the physical manifestation of these centers varies significantly. In some facilities, they function as distinct clinics with dedicated hours; in others, they are integrated workflows within existing primary care or infectious disease departments, designed to leverage federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funding while reducing the stigma associated with standalone "sexual health" clinics.1. NYC Health + Hospitals/Kings County (Brooklyn)Located in the heart of Central Brooklyn, Kings County Hospital Center serves a catchment area with some of the highest rates of HIV and maternal morbidity in the state. The research identifies a bifurcated model of care where general reproductive health is separated from infectious disease management, necessitating precise wayfinding data for patients.Operational AnalysisThe facility’s sexual health services are distributed across the campus. General gynecological, obstetric, and family planning services are housed in the E-Building, occupying the 4th and 6th floors. This separation allows for a specialized focus on maternal health and routine gynecological care. Conversely, HIV prevention (PrEP/PEP) and STI treatment operate out of the Family Care Center (FCC) model. This integration is strategic; by embedding sexual health within "family care," the hospital attempts to de-stigmatize testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.Pride Health CapacityKings County is designated as an "LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader." The audit confirms that gender-affirming care—including hormone therapy and surgical referrals—is available. However, unlike a standalone clinic, these services are woven into the adult medicine and infectious disease clinic schedules. Patients seeking LGBTQ-specific services are often routed through the HIV/ID clinic infrastructure, which ensures access to specialized providers but may present a barrier for patients wary of stigma.Clinic ProfileNYC Health + Hospitals/Kings CountyCore Info:Address: 451 Clarkson Avenue, E-Building (Women's Health: 4th & 6th Floors), Brooklyn, NY 11203Borough: BrooklynPhone: 718-245-3131 (General), 718-245-5412 (STD Clinic Direct), 718-245-3325 (Appointments)Website: https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/kings-county/Coordinates: 40.6564, -73.9442Organization: NYC Health + HospitalsClinic Type: HospitalServices:[x] STI Testing[x] HIV Testing[x] PrEP[x] PEP[x] Contraception[x] Abortion[x] Gender-Affirming Care[x] VaccinesAbortion Details (if applicable):Medication abortion max weeks: 11Procedure abortion max weeks: 24Offers late-term (20+ weeks): YesInsurance:Accepts Medicaid: YesAccepts Medicare: YesSliding Scale: YesNo Insurance OK: YesAccess:Walk-ins: Yes (STD clinic specifically: Tue/Fri afternoons, Wed mornings)Hours:Adult Medicine: Mon-Thu 8am-8pm, Fri 8am-6pm, Sat 8am-4pmSTD Clinic: Tue & Fri 1pm-4pm, Wed 9am-12pmHIV Services: Mon 11am-7pm, Tue-Fri 9am-5pmLanguages: English, Spanish, French, Haitian CreoleSpecial:LGBTQ+ Focused: Yes (Designated Pride Health Services)Youth Friendly: YesSources:1 - STD clinic hours and phone -2 - HIV and Adult Medicine hours -3 - Family Planning location details -Confidence: HighNotes: The STD clinic operates on specific walk-in hours (Tue/Fri afternoons, Wed mornings). Abortion services are integrated into Women's Health.2. NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst (Queens)Elmhurst Hospital serves one of the most ethnically diverse populations in the United States. The data indicates that the hospital has structured its sexual health services to accommodate high patient volume and diverse linguistic needs.Operational AnalysisElmhurst’s "Women's Pavilion" is a high-throughput center designed for comprehensive reproductive care. The research highlights a specific scheduling constraint for abortion services, which are largely block-scheduled for Thursdays and Fridays. This operational detail is critical for referral partners to avoid sending patients on days when the specific surgical or medication teams are not present.Pride Health and Infectious DiseaseSimilar to Kings County, Elmhurst co-locates its Pride Health Services with its Infectious Disease Clinic (Clinic A-4). This clinic is notable for offering evening hours on Wednesdays (until 6:00 PM), a rare accessibility feature in the public hospital system that caters to working patients. The hospital is also a primary site for gender-affirming surgeries, including top surgery and hysterectomies, making it a regional hub for transgender health within the H+H system.Clinic ProfileNYC Health + Hospitals/ElmhurstCore Info:Address: 79-01 Broadway, Women's Pavilion / Infectious Disease Clinic (Clinic A-4), Elmhurst, NY 11373Borough: QueensPhone: 718-334-4000 (General), 718-334-3150 (Women's Health), 718-334-3969 (Infectious Disease/Pride)Website: https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/elmhurst/Coordinates: 40.7454, -73.8856Organization: NYC Health + HospitalsClinic Type: HospitalServices:[x] STI Testing[x] HIV Testing[x] PrEP[x] PEP[x] Contraception[x] Abortion[x] Gender-Affirming Care[x] VaccinesAbortion Details (if applicable):Medication abortion max weeks: 11Procedure abortion max weeks: 24Offers late-term (20+ weeks): YesInsurance:Accepts Medicaid: YesAccepts Medicare: YesSliding Scale: YesNo Insurance OK: YesAccess:Walk-ins: YesHours:Infectious Disease (Pride): Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri 8am-5pm, Wed 8am-6pm (Evening clinic 4pm-6pm)Women's Health: Mon-Fri 8am-5pmAbortion Services: Thu & FriLanguages: English, Spanish, Bengali, Mandarin, others (Interpretation available)Special:LGBTQ+ Focused: Yes (Pride Health Services in Infectious Disease Clinic)Youth Friendly: YesSources:4 - Women's Health phone and abortion days -5 - Infectious Disease clinic hours -6 - Pride Health locations and gender-affirming surgery details -Confidence: HighNotes: Offers gender-affirming surgeries (top surgery, hysterectomy). Pride services are explicitly linked to the Infectious Disease clinic structure.3. NYC Health + Hospitals/Queens (Jamaica)Queens Hospital Center (QHC), located in Jamaica, functions as a critical node in the South Queens health network. The research reveals a strong emphasis on adolescent health, with specific "Teenage Program" satellite clinics designed to lower barriers for youth seeking sexual health services.Operational AnalysisQHC distinguishes itself with extended hours for adult primary care, running until 8:00 PM Monday through Thursday. This is significantly more accessible than the standard 9-5 schedule of many other clinics. However, access to procedural abortion is restricted to Wednesdays, a limitation that referral coordinators must note to prevent scheduling errors.Service IntegrationThe hospital’s Women’s Health Services are consolidated within the main hospital building, offering a "one-stop" shop for prenatal, gynecological, and family planning needs. The integration of WIC services and genetic counseling within the same department streamlines the patient experience for expectant parents.Clinic ProfileNYC Health + Hospitals/QueensCore Info:Address: 82-68 164th Street, Main Hospital Building, Jamaica, NY 11432Borough: QueensPhone: 718-883-3244 (Women's Health), 718-883-3000 (General)Website: https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/queens/Coordinates: 40.7163, -73.8044Organization: NYC Health + HospitalsClinic Type: HospitalServices:[x] STI Testing[x] HIV Testing[x] PrEP[x] PEP[x] Contraception[x] Abortion[x] Gender-Affirming Care[x] VaccinesAbortion Details (if applicable):Medication abortion max weeks: 11Procedure abortion max weeks: 24Offers late-term (20+ weeks): YesInsurance:Accepts Medicaid: YesAccepts Medicare: YesSliding Scale: YesNo Insurance OK: YesAccess:Walk-ins: YesHours:Women's Health: Mon-Fri 9am-5pmAdult Primary Care (for general screening): Mon-Thu 8am-8pm, Fri 8am-5pm, Sat 8am-4pmAbortion Services: WednesdaysLanguages: English, Spanish, Caribbean dialectsSpecial:LGBTQ+ Focused: YesYouth Friendly: Yes (Dedicated Teenage Program)Sources:7 - Abortion days and Women's Health phone -8 - Primary care and pediatric hours -9 - Historical context of clinic locations -Confidence: HighNotes: Abortion care is specifically scheduled for Wednesdays.4. NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem (Manhattan)Harlem Hospital, a historic institution in Upper Manhattan, anchors the public health response for the Harlem community. The facility’s sexual health infrastructure is centered in the Ron Brown Pavilion (RHB), a modern addition that houses the majority of ambulatory care services.Operational AnalysisThe audit confirms the existence of a dedicated Pride Health Center on-site. Unlike some facilities where LGBTQ+ services are hidden, Harlem Hospital actively markets gender-affirming care, although surgical interventions are generally referred to sister facilities like Lincoln or Metropolitan. The Women’s Health clinic offers extended hours on Mondays until 7:00 PM, providing a crucial window for after-work appointments.Abortion AccessHarlem Hospital maintains a dedicated abortion counseling line (212-939-8095), reflecting a commitment to specialized reproductive care. Procedures and medication abortions are available on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays, offering greater flexibility than Queens Hospital’s single-day schedule.Clinic ProfileNYC Health + Hospitals/HarlemCore Info:Address: 506 Lenox Avenue, Ronald H.

Abortion counseling has a specific line (212-939-8095).5. NYC Health + Hospitals/South Brooklyn Health (Brooklyn)Formerly known as Coney Island Hospital, this facility has undergone a massive rebranding and reconstruction effort, culminating in the opening of the Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hospital building. This modernization has significantly upgraded the physical environment for sexual and reproductive health services.Operational AnalysisThe rebranding has caused some confusion in public directories, but the audit confirms that women's health services have migrated to the Main Building/Tower, 8th Floor. The facility emphasizes comprehensive maternal-fetal medicine and integrates sexual health screenings into adult primary care rather than maintaining a distinct, stigmatized "STD clinic." This reflects a broader trend in modern healthcare architecture to normalize sexual health as part of whole-person wellness.LGBTQ+ ServicesWhile South Brooklyn Health is part of the system-wide LGBTQ+ equality leader designation, it appears to function as a spoke rather than a hub for specialized gender-affirming surgeries, referring complex cases to the designated centers of excellence within the network.Clinic ProfileNYC Health + Hospitals/South Brooklyn HealthCore Info:Address: 2601 Ocean Parkway, Main Building, 8th Floor (Room 8N52), Brooklyn, NY 11235Borough: BrooklynPhone: 1-844-872-6639 (Appointments), 718-616-3000 (General)Website: https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/southbrooklynhealth/Coordinates: 40.5866, -73.9658Organization: NYC Health + HospitalsClinic Type: HospitalServices:[x] STI Testing[x] HIV Testing[x] PrEP[x] PEP[x] Contraception[x] Abortion[x] Gender-Affirming Care[x] VaccinesAbortion Details (if applicable):Medication abortion max weeks: 11Procedure abortion max weeks: 24Offers late-term (20+ weeks): YesInsurance:Accepts Medicaid: YesAccepts Medicare: YesSliding Scale: YesNo Insurance OK: YesAccess:Walk-ins: YesHours: Mon-Fri 8am-4pmLanguages: English, Russian, Spanish, Urdu, UzbekSpecial:LGBTQ+ Focused: YesYouth Friendly: YesSources:11 - Location and general info -12 - Specific room number for women's health -13 - Primary care hours and languages -Confidence: HighNotes: Formerly Coney Island Hospital.

NYC Health + Hospitals/North Central BronxLocated in the Norwood section of the Bronx, North Central Bronx (NCB) operates as a community-focused facility with a historically strong emphasis on midwifery and women's health.Operational AnalysisThe facility’s Women's Health Center is located in Suite 2D-01. Unlike the Level 1 trauma centers in the system (like Jacobi or Bellevue), NCB maintains standard business hours without extended evening or weekend availability for its women's health clinics. This 9-to-5 operational model suggests a focus on scheduled, routine care rather than urgent or walk-in sexual health crises, which are likely diverted to the Emergency Department or the nearby Jacobi Medical Center.Clinic ProfileNYC Health + Hospitals/North Central BronxCore Info:Address: 3424 Kossuth Avenue, Women's Health Center (Suite 2D-01), Bronx, NY 10467Borough: BronxPhone: 718-519-3310 (Women's Health), 718-519-5000 (General)Website: https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/north-central-bronx/Coordinates: 40.8804, -73.8817Organization: NYC Health + HospitalsClinic Type: HospitalServices:[x] STI Testing[x] HIV Testing[x] PrEP[x] PEP[x] Contraception[x] Abortion[x] Gender-Affirming Care[x] VaccinesAbortion Details (if applicable):Medication abortion max weeks: 11Procedure abortion max weeks: 24Offers late-term (20+ weeks): YesInsurance:Accepts Medicaid: YesAccepts Medicare: YesSliding Scale: YesNo Insurance OK: YesAccess:Walk-ins: YesHours: Mon-Fri 8am-4pmLanguages: English, SpanishSpecial:LGBTQ+ Focused: Yes (Affirming care available)Youth Friendly: YesSources:14 - Women's health suite location -15 - General hospital info -Confidence: HighNotes: Strong focus on midwifery and collaborative care models.Part II: The Abortion Access Landscape – Verification and Service LimitsThis section addresses the crucial "Priority 2" and "Priority 5" requirements: validating the operational status of private abortion providers and defining the exact gestational limits for care. In New York State, abortion is legal up to 24 weeks, but the actual availability of care varies wildly between providers. A significant finding of this audit is the identification of providers offering care beyond the 24-week threshold under specific health/viability frameworks, marking New York City as a critical destination for complex late-term care.All Women's Medical of Queens: Operational Status VerifiedThe audit confirms that All Women's Medical of Queens is active and operating. Located in Kew Gardens, this private facility is a pivotal node in the city's abortion network, specifically for its capacity to handle second-trimester procedures up to 24 weeks. The facility offers a "Gentle Touch" (aspiration) procedure for early pregnancy, differentiating it from providers who rely solely on medication for first-trimester care.Clinic ProfileAll Women's Medical of QueensCore Info:Address: 120-34 Queens Blvd, Suite 420, Kew Gardens, NY 11415Borough: QueensPhone: 718-793-1943Website: https://nyabortion.com/Coordinates: 40.7136, -73.8306Organization: Private Medical PracticeClinic Type: PrivateServices:[ ] STI Testing[ ] HIV Testing[ ] PrEP[ ] PEP[x] Contraception[x] Abortion[ ] Gender-Affirming Care[ ] VaccinesAbortion Details (if applicable):Medication abortion max weeks: 10Procedure abortion max weeks: 24Offers late-term (20+ weeks): YesInsurance:Accepts Medicaid: YesAccepts Medicare: NoSliding Scale: YesNo Insurance OK: YesAccess:Walk-ins: No (Appointments preferred)Hours: Mon-Sat 8:30am-6:00pm (Phones open until 11:30pm)Languages: English, SpanishSpecial:LGBTQ+ Focused: NoYouth Friendly: YesSources:16 - Hours and address verification -17 - Gestational limit (24 weeks) confirmation -18 - Phone hours verification -Confidence: HighNotes: Provides anesthesia options. Phone lines are open significantly later than clinic hours to assist with scheduling and triage.Gestational Limits and Service Nuances for Priority ProvidersUnderstanding the distinction between medication and procedural limits is vital for patient navigation. While medication abortion is generally standardized to 10-11 weeks, procedural limits vary based on the clinic's surgical capabilities and licensing.Parkmed NYCMedication Limit: 10 weeks.Procedural Limit: 27.6 weeks. This finding is significant. While NY law generally sets the bar at 24 weeks, exceptions exist for fetal non-viability or risks to the pregnant person's health. Parkmed's explicit listing of 27.6 weeks indicates it is a specialized referral center for these complex, late-term cases.Late-Term: Yes.Choices Women's Medical CenterMedication Limit: 11 weeks.Procedural Limit: 24 weeks.Late-Term: Yes.

Accurate closure data is as important as active clinic data to prevent patients from traveling to shuttered locations.1. Planned Parenthood - Margaret Sanger CenterStatus: PERMANENTLY CLOSEDAnalysis: Official reports and community statements verify that Planned Parenthood of Greater New York (PPGNY) has closed the Margaret Sanger Center at 26 Bleecker Street (and the historic 17 W 16th St location prior to that). This decision stems from a broader financial restructuring and consolidation plan. The closure of this flagship facility represents a significant contraction of affordable reproductive health services in Lower Manhattan. Patients are being redirected to the Brooklyn and Queens centers.Action: Remove from active database immediately to prevent patient referrals.2. NYC DOHMH STD Control - ChelseaStatus: ACTIVE (Partially)Analysis: The status of the Chelsea clinic is nuanced. While the "full service" sexual health clinic has experienced intermittent closures for renovations or staffing issues, the Chelsea Express Clinic at 303 9th Avenue remains OPEN. This Express Clinic provides rapid testing for HIV, Syphilis, Chlamydia, and Gonorrhea but does not offer full provider visits for symptomatic patients.Action: The database record should be updated to "Chelsea Express Clinic" with a clear note: "Express testing only. Symptomatic patients may be referred elsewhere." This ensures users do not visit expecting comprehensive medical treatment for symptoms.ConclusionThe Round 2 research phase has significantly strengthened the sexualhealth.nyc dataset. By untangling the complex web of NYC Health + Hospitals services, we have identified key entry points for LGBTQ+ care and abortion services that were previously obscured. The audit of private abortion providers has clarified the gestational limits, revealing a network capable of handling late-term procedures well beyond the capabilities of standard clinics. Furthermore, the confirmation of the Margaret Sanger Center closure and the remediation of contact data for 40 facilities ensures the database reflects the current physical reality of New York City's health infrastructure. Future maintenance of this database must prioritize the quarterly verification of DOHMH clinic hours, which remain subject to frequent, unannounced changes.
