# Gap Analysis: Is sexualhealth.nyc Necessary?

**Last Updated:** December 23, 2025

## Summary

Yes. We have more data, better UX, and NYC-specific features that competitors lack.

| -------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **INeedAnA.com**           | 3           | We have 7x more abortion providers      |
| **AbortionFinder.org**     | ~10         | We have 2x more with gestational limits |
| **Amida Care GIST**        | 16          | We have all 16 + 159 more               |

## What We Track That Competitors Don't

**Abortion**

- Medication vs procedural limits (separate fields)
- Walk-in availability
- Specific Medicaid MCO acceptance

**Gender-Affirming Care**

- Informed consent HRT
- Youth services
- Specific procedures (FFS, FMS, voice therapy, electrolysis, laser, top/bottom surgery)

**Access**

- Subway lines and bus routes
- Structured hours (not free text)
- Sliding scale availability
- 20 languages (competitors: English + Spanish only)

## Why Existing Resources Fall Short

**Abortion Finders (AbortionFinder.org, INeedAnA.com)**
Single-issue focus, only 3-10 NYC clinics. We have 21 with more granular data.

**GAC Directories (Amida Care GIST)**
PDFs and static lists, limited to specific insurance networks. We have all their facilities plus 159 more, with filterable procedures.

**NYC Health Map (Official)**
Clunky UX, overwhelming non-sexual-health data, no transit filtering. We're focused, fast, and mobile-first.

## Risks

1. **Data freshness** — Volunteer model is fragile. Mitigation: automated source monitoring, periodic verification calls.

2. **Trust** — New domain needs to earn credibility. Mitigation: clear data source citations, professional design.

## Next Steps

1. Fill remaining 19 clinics missing hours (volunteer calls)
2. Add DAC certification badge to eligible clinics
3. Quarterly re-verification of hours data
