# Gap Analysis: Is sexualhealth.nyc Necessary?

**Last Updated:** December 23, 2025

## Summary

Yes. We aggregate data from multiple sources into one NYC-focused, multilingual directory with features the existing resources don't offer.

## Our Data

| Metric                | Count                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Physical clinics      | 175                          |
| Virtual/telehealth    | 9                            |
| Abortion providers    | 21 (with gestational limits) |
| Gender-affirming care | 34                           |
| STI/HIV testing       | 58                           |
| PrEP providers        | 139                          |
| PEP providers         | 79                           |
| Contraception         | 43                           |
| Accepts Medicaid      | 62                           |
| Hours coverage        | 89%                          |

## Data Sources We Built On

| Source                     | Their NYC Data | What We Added                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **INeedAnA.com**           | 3 clinics      | 18 more abortion providers                 |
| **AbortionFinder.org**     | ~10 clinics    | Gestational limits, insurance, walk-in     |
| **Amida Care GIST**        | 16 facilities  | 159 more facilities, filterable procedures |
| **NYS DAC List**           | 33 facilities  | All 33 included, plus hours and transit    |
| **NYS PrEP Provider Dir.** | 156 facilities | 139 included with structured hours         |

## What We Add

**Abortion**

- Medication vs procedural limits (separate fields)
- Walk-in availability
- Specific Medicaid MCO acceptance

**Gender-Affirming Care**

- Informed consent HRT
- Youth services
- Specific procedures (FFS, FMS, voice therapy, electrolysis, laser, top/bottom surgery)

**Access**

- Subway lines and bus routes
- Structured hours (not free text)
- Sliding scale availability
- 20 languages (most resources: English + Spanish only)

## Why This Directory Exists

**Abortion finders** are single-issue. Great for what they do, but if you need PrEP and contraception too, you're searching multiple sites.

**GAC directories** are PDFs and static lists, often limited to specific insurance networks.

**NYC Health Map** is comprehensive but overwhelming — too much non-sexual-health data, no transit filtering.

We took the best data from all of these, added NYC-specific features (transit, 20 languages), and made it searchable in one place.

## Risks

1. **Data freshness** — Volunteer model is fragile. Mitigation: automated source monitoring, periodic verification calls.

2. **Trust** — New domain needs to earn credibility. Mitigation: clear data source citations, professional design.

## Next Steps

1. Fill remaining 19 clinics missing hours (volunteer calls)
2. Add DAC certification badge to eligible clinics
3. Quarterly re-verification of hours data
