# Data Verification Priorities

This document identifies clinics where our directory data may need verification. Generated from automated website scanning, then manually filtered to remove false positives.

## How to Use This Document

**For volunteers:** Pick a clinic, call them, and verify the specific issue. Report findings via [contact form](https://sexualhealth.nyc/contact).

**False positives removed:** "PrEP keyword not found on homepage" was flagged for many clinics but is NOT a real issue - PrEP services exist even if not mentioned on landing pages. Same for abortion services at H+H hospitals.

## Priority 1: Phone Number Verification Needed

These clinics have phone numbers that may be outdated. A quick call can confirm.

| Clinic                                   | Listed Phone   | Notes                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Housing Works - Ginny Shubert Center     | (212) 971-0428 | Verify current number              |
| Eastside Gynecology                      | (212) 308-4988 | Private practice, may have changed |
| SAGE Center                              | (212) 741-2247 | Verify main intake line            |
| Community Health Action of Staten Island | (718) 808-1300 | Verify current number              |

## Priority 2: Address Verification Needed

These clinics have addresses that may need updating (suite/floor numbers, or building changes).

| Clinic                           | Listed Address            | Issue                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Maze Women's Sexual Health       | 633 3rd Ave #9b, NYC      | Suite number may have changed |
| Mount Sinai West Family Planning | 1000 Tenth Ave, 2nd Floor | Floor/entrance may differ     |
| SAGE Center                      | 305 7th Ave, 15th Floor   | Floor may have changed        |

## Priority 3: Multi-Location Organizations

These organizations have multiple locations. Our URLs point to main sites, not location-specific pages. Consider updating URLs to location-specific pages for better user experience.

**Planned Parenthood Greater NY:**

- Bronx Center (349 E 149th St)
- Joan Malin Health Center
- Staten Island Center
- Queens (Diane L. Max) - _already has specific URL_

**Community Healthcare Network (CHN):**

- All CHN locations point to location-specific pages (good)

**NYC Health + Hospitals:**

- Most H+H locations point to hospital homepages, not specific clinic pages
- Consider finding direct links to sexual health/family planning departments

---

## Not Issues (Removed from list)

The following were flagged by automated scanning but are **not actual problems**:

1. **"PrEP keyword not on homepage"** - All Callen-Lorde, CHN, H+H, and Planned Parenthood locations offer PrEP even if not prominently featured on landing pages.

2. **"Abortion keyword not on homepage"** - H+H hospitals offer abortion services through their OB/GYN or Family Planning departments, which aren't always linked from main hospital pages.

3. **Phone/address "not found on page"** - Large hospital systems (H+H, Mount Sinai) use centralized websites where individual clinic contact info isn't on the main page. This doesn't mean our data is wrong.
