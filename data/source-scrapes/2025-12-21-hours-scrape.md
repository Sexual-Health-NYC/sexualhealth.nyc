## Key Findings

1. **PP Bronx hours were WRONG** - We had M-F 8am-4:30pm, actual is M-Th 8-7, Fri 8-6
2. **Callen-Lorde Chelsea hours were WRONG** - We had simplified hours, actual has different Fri/Sat hours
3. **All Callen-Lorde locations accept walk-ins** for HIV testing and PEP
4. **All PP locations now offer gender-affirming hormone therapy for 16-17 year olds** (with parental consent)
